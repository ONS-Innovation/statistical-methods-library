# Statistical Methods Library 9.0.0

Release date: 2022-11-29

## Synopsis

This release addresses various floating point accuracy issues by using
arbitrary precision arithmetic for all calculations where such issues may
occur.

## Changes

All methods now expect columns which were previously double precision to be
of type decimal and uses this type when outputting columns which would have
previously been of double precision. This type provides arbitrary precision
arithmetic with support for increasing the precision where calculations
require.

## Notes

No type casting is performed on either the input or output data frames. Thus
providing columns using double precision where decimal types are now
expected will cause an error as with any other incorrect data types.

To avoid loss of precision, the exact precision of the output data frames is
unspecified. This can be enforced by explicitly casting the output from the
methods.
