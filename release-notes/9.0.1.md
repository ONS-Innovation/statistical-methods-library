# Statistical Methods Library 9.0.1

Release date: 2022-12-06

## Synopsis

This release corrects a minor issue in the usage of arbitrary precision
arithmetic.

## Changes

The `outliering.winsorisation` and `estimation.ht_ratio` methods now use the
default precision and scale when casting boolean columns. This avoids an
issue where the precision was artificially being forced over the maximum which resulted in unnecessary precision loss.

## Notes

This change may increase the precision of output columns from the
`outliering.winsorisation` and `estimation.ht_ratio` methods.
