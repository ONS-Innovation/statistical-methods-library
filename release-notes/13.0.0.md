# Statistical Methods Library 13.0.0

Release date: 2023-06-19

## Synopsis

This release loosens several dependency constraints as well as removing the
need to provide the auxiliary variable in imputation back data.

## Changes

### Dependencies

The supported versions of Pyspark now include every version from 3.1.1 up to
the 3.3 series. Python versions from 3.7 up to and including 3.10 are now
also supported.

### Imputation

The auxiliary variable is no longer required in back data as the previous
erroneous use of this variable to calculate unused construction links for
the back data periods no longer occurs.

## Notes

Although Python 3.7, 3.8, 3.9 and 3.10 are tested these tests are conducted
against the latest version of Pyspark 3.3. It is recommended to update the
installed versions of Pyspark and Python where possible as the aim is to
drop support for older versions of Pyspark as soon as possible.
