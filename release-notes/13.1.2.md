# Statistical Methods Library 13.1.2

Release date: 2023-07-19

## Synopsis

This release fixes handling of a particular case regarding link filtering in
the Ratio of Means forward and backward ratio calculator.

## Changes

The Ratio of Means forward and backward ratio calculator now correctly
filters out values when the link filter matches the current period but not
the ones directly preceding and succeeding it. For several releases any
non-null values in such prior and successive periods were not filtered out
of ratio calculations even when they did not match the provided link filter.

## Notes

This bug appears to have been first introduced in the 12.0.0 release and
thus any outputs generated using Ratio of Means imputation and a link filter
with releases from 12.0.0 until 13.1.1 will potentially be different from
those generated with this release.
