# Statistical Methods Library 13.1.1

Release date: 2023-06-23

## Synopsis

This release fixes a crash when passing a link filter and not passing back
data to imputation.

Imputation can now handle passing a link filter without back data.
Previously it would incorrectly attempt to use back data in this case and
crash due to the data frame being None.

## Notes

This change has no impact on existing outputs.
