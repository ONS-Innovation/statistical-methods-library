# Statistical Methods Library 13.2.0

Release date: 2023-11-20

## Synopsis

This release alters the output of the Winsorisation method to support
winsorising multiple independent variables for a single reference within
a given period.

## Changes

The input validation for the Winsorisation method previously required that a single reference appear once in
each period. This requirement has been changed to allow a reference to
appear once per grouping and period combination. This permits winsorising
multiple independent variables at once by using the grouping column to
reflect both the grouping and variable. In addition, the grouping
column will now be present in the Winsorisation output to distinguish these variables.

## Notes

With the exception of the additional column, there is no impact on existing
usage in terms of numerical changes. This is because the grouping column was
already used internally for grouping data. This release merely removes the input
restriction constraining one reference to one group.
