# Statistical Methods Library 11.0.2

Release date: 2023-04-12

## Synopsis

Remove type validation for some period columns as they are only used for data grouping.

## Changes

In line with the changes in the previous release, the period columns in some
methods are also only present for grouping purposes and thus checking their
data types in the input schema is unnecessary. This release removes these
checks.

## Notes

This change applies to the column referenced by the `period_col` parameter
in the HT Ratio Estimation and Winsorisation methods. This column is still
checked in Imputation since this method relies on the format of the period
to perform calculations.

This release does not have any impact on method outputs produced by existing
code.
