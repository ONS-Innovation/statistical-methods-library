# Statistical Methods Library 9.1.0

Release date: 2023-02-06

## Synopsis

This release addresses a conflict between the imputation link filtering of matched pairs and
the use of back data functionalities in the ratio of means method.

## Changes

Ratio of Means link filtering now happens after back data is validated
and if there is back data it will be added to the input data before being data is passed to the filter.

Testing has also been changed to merge the back data testing into the main testing section.
This will mean that the methadology provided data will be run as ordinary data and then run again
with the first period used as back data.
This means all testing scenarios are covered with and without back data.

## Notes

The way the methadology provided data is used to test back data is by taking the expected output file
and splitting it into back data (the first period) and the new expected output (all other periods).
This is possible because there shold be no change to the links based on if the links are calculated
with or without back data due to the actual data being the same figures.
