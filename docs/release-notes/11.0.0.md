# Statistical Methods Library 11.0.0

Release date: 2023-02-28

## Synopsis

Split out imputation engine, correct parameter validation and switch to
keyword only arguments for Ratio of Means Imputation.

## Changes

Ratio of Means imputation now only accepts keyword arguments. In addition,
the imputation engine has been moved into a separate module to allow the
ratio calculation function to be specified.

This release also makes parameter validation for all methods compliant with
the documentation. In particular, None was previously permitted as a value
for a required column name which then caused code relying on the value to
fail. This now raises an error as expected.

## Notes

All the arguments to Ratio of Means have the same meaning as in the previous
release. In addition, this release does not introduce any output changes.
