# Statistical Methods Library 11.0.0

Release date: 2023-02-28

## Synopsis

For Ratio of Means, HT Estimation and Winsorisation it was possible to pass in
a None value for the target column in these methods and it would not be caught
by the validation. This has been corrected.

In preparation for new functionality the Ratio of Means imputation method has
been split into a reusable engine component and a specific feature element.

## Changes

In the Ratio of Means imputation method, when calling the method it will no
longer accept positional arguments.
All arguments passed my be keyword arguments.

## Notes

Due to the keyword argument change, users who did not use keywork arguments
when calling this method will find that they will not be able to update to this
new version cleanly. Users who already used keyword arguments will have no ill
effects from updating.

As this is an API change for the Ratio of Means method this release is a major
version change.
