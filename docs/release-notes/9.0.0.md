# Statistical methods Library 9.0.0

Release date: 2022-11-29

## Synopsis

This release addresses various floating point accuracy issues by switching
to the Pyspark Decimal type for all calculations where such issues may
occur.

## Changes

All methods now expect columns which were previously double precision to be
of type decimal and uses this type when outputting columns which would have
previously been of double precision.

## Notes

No type casting is performed on either the input or output data frames.
Providing columns using double precision where decimal types are now
expected will cause an error as with any other incorrect data types.
