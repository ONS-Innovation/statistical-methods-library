# Statistical Methods Library 11.0.1

Release date: 2023-03-08

## Synopsis

Remove type validation for columns which are only used for data grouping.

## Changes

Previously, columns only used for data grouping in methods were only allowed
to contain data of StringType. This doesn't really make sense since these
columns are only used in group by clauses and thus the type doesn't matter.
This release removes these restrictions.

## Notes

The effected methods and associated columns (named by method parameter) are
as follows:

* Imputation - `grouping_col`
* HT Ratio Estimation - `strata_col` and `calibration_group_col`
* Winsorisation - `grouping_col`

This release does not have any impact on method outputs.
