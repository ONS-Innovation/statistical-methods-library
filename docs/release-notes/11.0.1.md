# Statistical Methods Library 11.0.1

Release date: 2023-03-08

## Synopsis

Remove type validation for columns which are only used for data identification.

## Changes

Previously, columns used for data identification (both individual
contributors and data grouping) in methods were only allowed to contain
strings. This doesn't really make sense since these identification columns
are only used in contexts where the type doesn't matter. This release
removes these restrictions.

## Notes

The effected methods and associated columns (named by method parameter) are
as follows:

* Imputation - `reference_col` and `grouping_col`
* HT Ratio Estimation - `unique_identifier_col`, `strata_col` and
  `calibration_group_col`
* Winsorisation - `reference_col` and `grouping_col`

This release does not have any impact on method outputs.
