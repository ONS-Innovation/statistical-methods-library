# Statistical Methods Library 9.1.1

Release date: 2023-02-07

## Synopsis

This release removes a piece of unused code.

## Changes

In the Ratio of Means imputation method, as part of back data processing,
this method drops the target column but back data is an output from Ratio of
Means imputation and so does not contain the target column.

## Notes

No changes have been made to the functionality of the library, this is only
removing code that does not do anything.
