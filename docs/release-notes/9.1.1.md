# Statistical Methods Library 9.1.1

Release date: 2023-02-07

## Synopsis

This release removes a piece of unused code.

## Changes

In the Ratio of Means imputation method, as part of back data processing
the methid drops the target column. But back data is the output of Ration of
Means imputation and so does not contain the target column.

## Notes

No changes have been made to functionality of the library, this is only removing
code that does not do anything.
