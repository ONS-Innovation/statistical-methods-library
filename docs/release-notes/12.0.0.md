# Statistical Methods Library 11.0.2

Release date: 2023-??-??

## Synopsis

IMPUTATION:
Added Mean of Ratios ratio calculator.
Added Weighting functionality.
Changed API call.
New marker columns for filtered rows.
Count columns no longer produce null values, default link marker column instead.
Validation adjustment to allow multi variable calculations.

## Changes

Changed API to now require users to call the generic engine and pass in which ratio calculator to use. Mean of Ratios is a new ratio calculator alongside Ratio of Means.

Alongside new output columns for mean of ratios, filtering now produces marker columns to better distinguish where data is not used in link calculations. To remove confusion, count columns no longer leave the count as null when links are defaulted due to no responses and zero when defaulted due to divide by zero error. Instead they now always have a number and use a default marker to distingush between, a default due to missing data or not defaulted and set to 1 when mathmatical error occurs.

Weighting functionality is now available for both ratio of means and mean of ratios.
Validation required data to be unique of identifier and period. Now the grouping is also part of the unique requirements.

## Notes

Testing has been adjusted. Unit test are separate and run against the engine. Ratio calculators are all run as scenarios, using generic code to allow new tests to be easily added.
